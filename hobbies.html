                        <p>Although I did not grow up as an avid fisherman, my appreciation for the sport has grown significantly over the past years. Many of my closest friends are passionate about fishing, and their enthusiasm has influenced me. In the summers of 2024 and 2025, we took trips to Ontario, Canada, where we spent several days immersed in fishing and enjoying each other’s company. Those experiences—filled with early mornings on the water, late nights in the cabin, and unforgettable moments with friends—made me truly value the sport. Fishing has become one of my favorite hobbies because it combines relaxation, adventure, and meaningful time with the people closest to me.

                    <div class="personal-story">
                        <p>Spending time outdoors is something I deeply enjoy, whether it involves hiking, camping, or simply exploring new places. Being in nature allows me to disconnect from daily routines and fully appreciate the natural beauty around me. One memorable experience was a trip my friends and I took in the summer of 2025 to Silver Bay, Minnesota, where we hiked six miles to the Bean and Bear Lake area. We spent the weekend camping, swimming, and fishing, all while surrounded by incredible scenery. Adventures like these remind me of the value of the outdoors and the sense of peace and connection it brings.

                    <div class="personal-story">
                        <p>Photography is a hobby I enjoy because it allows me to capture meaningful moments and preserve the beauty of nature. Whether it’s a landscape, a sunset, or a memorable trip with friends, taking photos helps me hold onto the experiences that matter most. I appreciate the creative aspect of photography as well, as it encourages me to look at the world from different perspectives and notice details I might otherwise overlook.
